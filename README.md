love:you
========

> The most romantic thing I could remember

> Is getting older with you

Show your love to your love today.
That is something we have.

It's quite easy to use this package.
Add this package to your app,
publish it,
then tell your honey to open the developer console(you may describe it as `F12`),
boom,
alright.

Another way is `{{love 'Holy'}}`, which shows a text like:

> I love you Holy. This app is specially built for you. Love lasts forever.

You may need a Chinese version if you are a Chinese like me:

    LoveYou.lang='zh_cn';

It takes effect on both console and helper.

>PS: Write it in your language and submit a PR please :)
